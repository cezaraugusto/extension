`extension-create` is a monorepo consisting of multiple programs and packages.

- Programs: Each CLI command (including the CLI itself) is a program.
- Packages: Helper libraries and built-in webpack plugins.

## Programs

`extension-create` includes several command line programs, each serving a specific purpose in the extension development lifecycle:

| Program   | Description                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cli`     | The Command Line Interface that executes the extension-create programs.                      |
| `create`  | Create extensions from built-in templates.                                                   |
| `develop` | Wrapper around the webpack config that consists of the `dev`, `start`, and `build` commands. |
| `publish` | This is empty for now.                                                                       |

## Installation

1. Clone the project `git@github.com:cezaraugusto/extension-create.git` && `cd extension-create`.
2. Install dependencies (will symlink files where appropriate) `yarn install`
3. Create an `.env` file at the project root and add `EXTENSION_ENV=development`

## Usage

To watch and apply changes to the project, you will need two or more terminals open:

### Terminal 1: Use it to watch file changes (yarn watch)

```sh
yarn watch
```

> **NOTE:** The browser runners (`run-chrome-extension` and `run-edge-extension`) are not
> watched by default, since they trigger the execution of the browser binary. To see changes
> applied to these packages, apply a `yarn compile` command either globally (at project root)
> or individually (running `yarn compile` at the package folder level).

### Terminal 2: Use it to actually execute the commands you want to test.

The CLI is available internally as an npm script `yarn extension <command> [argument]`.
Use it to experiment with the multiple extension-create CLI commands.

```sh
yarn extension <command> [argument]
```

## Useful Commands

The monorepo's `package.json` includes scripts that affect all programs and packages at once
and are needed for the project development.

### Compile

Compiles (builds) packages and programns. This npm script generates the `/dist` folder that other packages may consume.

```sh
yarn compile
```

### Watch

Like compile, but listens for code changes, where it compiles again.

> Note: You want a terminal always running this command during development.

```sh
yarn watch
```

### Lint

Iterates over all projects and lint them using ESLint.

```sh
yarn lint
```

### Test

Run the test suite of each package and program (where available).

```sh
yarn test
```

### Clean

Deletes cache, dist/ and node_modules/ across packages and programs .

```sh
yarn clean
```

### copyTypesFolder

This special command copies the original README.md file from the Monorepo and applies to packages/cli, which is what we publish on npm.

```sh
yarn copyTypesFolder
```
